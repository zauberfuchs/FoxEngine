# This file contains rules that control how Git handles binary and text files, including line endings
#
# Make sure Windows batch files preserve CR/LF line endings, otherwise they may not be able to execute.  Windows
# batch files require a CR/LF for labels to work properly, otherwise they may fail when labels straddle 512-byte
# block boundaries.  This is important when files are downloaded through a zip archive that was authored on a
# Linux machine (the default behavior on GitHub)
*.bat eol=crlf
# Auto detect text files and perform LF normalization
* text=auto
# Unreal Engine
# Known issue with some remote repos : malloc error
# can be fixed by adding -delta to uasset and umap
